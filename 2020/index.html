<h1>FRC Team 4919 2020 Robot Design Coming Soon!</h1>
<p>Watch Kick-Off video and receive Kit of Parts.  After the video return to LCHS. Use Multi-purpose room with about eight
  tables and chairs with about 4 copies of the printed manual and distributed to the tables broken out into sections. 
  (That is 4 copies of section 1 at table 1, 4 copies of section 2 at table 2, ...)
  Discuss the video and then split up in to groups to break down the manual for the rest of the day and later start to discuss 
  options for scoring points.</p>
<h2>Game Decomposition  - Define Requirements for scoring points and playing the game</h2>
Is there a defensive strategy?
<h2>Function Breakdown  - Define Requirements </h2>
<p>Green - easy, black - medium, red - hard</p>
<h2>Alternative Designs</h2>
<p>Remember one of the first critical items to figure out is the type of drive train and wheels and size of drivebase. 
The drive train is one of first items that has to be fabricated to determine other items (functions) and how they mount and space.</p>
<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<h3>First Alternative Design </h3>
<p>Include strategy, functions performed and some views (top, side, and/or front to give indications of placment of functions).
</p>
<p>Make note of maximum physical constraints of Robot</p>
<h3>Second Alternative Design</h3>
<h3>Third Alternative Design</h3>
<h3>Fourth Alternative Design</h3>
<h2>Final Design</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Include goals/game strategies and functions performed</p>
<h3>Scale Drawings</h3>
<h3>Scale Drawing Side View</h3>
<h3>Scale Drawing Top View</h3>
<h2>Control System Design</h2>
<h3>Control Signals Map</h3>
<h3>Power Schematic</h3>
<h3>Signal Schematic</h3>
<h3>Pneumatic Schematic</h3>
<h2>BOM</h2>
