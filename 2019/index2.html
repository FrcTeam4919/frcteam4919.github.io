<h2>
	Lessons Learned
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Control Systems</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Should use nylock nuts to connect battery wires to battery terminals </li>
		<li> Use crimpped connectors on battery wires connecting to battery terminals </li>
		<li> Note: Small black battery chargers show green even when not connected - one charger had loose connection </li>
		<li> Need to rework battery cart so it is more portable (add Casters) and batteries are more accessible. currently the battery cables are stressed when loading/unloading batteries</li>
		<li> Preplanning the batteries worked well. Should do it before the match though< /li> 
		<li> Captured screw size and length for contorl components. </li>
		<li> Recommend each subsystem team produce estimated parts list (BOM) during planning stages them update BOM post build </li>
		<li> Only Noticed battery/lift mechanism interference at competition </li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
		<li>Keep Prototypes for Practice driving/operating</li>
		<li>Keep Teams engaged</li>
		<li>improve management/organization of team members activities at competition</li>
		<li> We learned the difference "image" and "Firmware" on RoboRio at competition, on the field, ...</li>
		<li>What is fastest way to a practice bot?</li>
		</li would be usefull to profile battery drain via log and log operator input and other status</li>
		<li>The camera did not seem as useful as planned, why?</li>
	</ul>
