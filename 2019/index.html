<h1>FRC Team 4919 2019 Robot Design</h1>
<p>Saturday January 5th schedule (6:00am to 5:00pm) for Leodroids went to Kearny High School for Kick-Off video and to 
  receive Kit of Parts for selected students.  After the video, students at Kearny High School picked up the Kit of Parts 
  and then returned to LCHS.  Students at LCHS  helped by setting up the room with about eight tables and chairs and assist 
  with preparing getting the manual printed and distributed to the tables. Once all the students were back at LCHS, we 
  discussed the video and then broke up in to groups to break down the manual for the rest of the day and started to discuss 
  options.</p>

<p>Remember one of the first critical items to figure out is the type of drvie train.  Wheeled (2, 3, or 4 per side), tank 
  track, or something else.  The drive train is one of first items that has to be fabricated to determine other items 
  (functions) and how they mount and space.</p>
